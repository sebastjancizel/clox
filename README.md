# clox Interpreter

This repository contains an implementation of the `clox` interpreter, based on the book ["Crafting Interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom. `clox` is a bytecode virtual machine for the Lox programming language, a small, high-level scripting language designed for learning purposes.

This is a personal project driven by my interest in programming languages and compilers. I am using this project as a stepping stone towards understanding compilers and interpreters. It's also my way of furthering my knowledge of C, which means that the code includes (potentially excessive) comments and explanations.

## Features

- High-level scripting language
- Dynamic typing
- Lexical scoping
- First-class functions and closures
- Object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance
- Garbage collection
- Bytecode compilation and execution

## Building and Running

To build and run the `clox` interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/clox.git
cd clox
```
2. Compile the project:

```
make
```
3. Run in interactive mode:
```
./bin/clox
```
